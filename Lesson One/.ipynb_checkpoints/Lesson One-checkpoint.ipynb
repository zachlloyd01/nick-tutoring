    "    - Floats are how Python stores numbers!\n",

    "    - Strings are how Python stores text data!\n",

    "## String Interpolation\n",
    "- `Interpolation` means to insert. \n",
    "    - When working with `strings` it means to add to it!\n",
    "    \n",
    "### How to do it?\n",
    "- To combine two strings, simply use the `+` `operator`!\n",
    "    - For example, if I wanted to combine the words 'hello' and 'world' into one string, I could do this:\n",
    "        - `new_string = 'Hello' + 'World!'\n",

    "            - `%` gets the remainder after division.\n",
    "            - `**` is used for exponentiation\n",
    "            - `//` is used for floor division!\n",
